# APPLE-FRUIT-DETECTION
AUTOMATIC APPLE FRUIT DETECTION USING DEEP  LEARNING
In this project, an efficient approach has been proposed to localize every clearly visible 
object from an image. For object detection we have processed every input image to overcome 
several complexities, to achieve better result we use object detection algorithm. We have 
also implemented Convolution Neural Network based on object detection model i.e YOLOV3.Fruit Detection model that is very proficient regardless of different limitations such as 
high and poor image quality, same fruit but different shape, size and color, multiple 
overlapped fruits. This model is capable of detecting single fruit separately from a set of 
overlapping fruits. Nevertheless, taking a number of challenges into consideration, our 
proposed model is capable of detecting fruits from image with a better accuracy and average 
precision rate.
